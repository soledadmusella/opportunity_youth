# Report

## This directory contains a polished notebook that states the business problem and summarizes your solution, along with high level takeaways. ##

**This report focuses on creating a short overview of the Opportunity Youth within South King County. As of 2016 there were roughly 19,000 opportunity youth within the area that were disengaged from school and work. There is a nonprofit within the community that hopes to tackle this issue working along side the local government. 

The Seattle Region Partnership (SRP) would like to have an update on the matter to hopefully use a metric to restructure and replan their initiatives. This report also helps to summarise the most conflicted area of King County. 

In order to give an update we have focused on: 
   1. created a visualised map that shows South King County, this is to show how large of an impact South King County has on the overall opportunity youth within King County. 
   2. A breakdown of the count of opportunity youth by the  Public Use of Microdata (PUMA) within South King County. This will give a rough number estimate within the region. 
   3. Updating the table that shows Opportunity Youth Status by Age located on page 2 of the 2016 report “Opportunity Youth in the Road Map Project Region”; and
   4. A visualization that highlights a trend between the 2016 report and current data.


## The summaries above have been separated into three different notebooks, all of which will be located within the **report** folder.

# Overall Assumptions Due to Readings and Research

After conducting our research and doing a quick overlook on the data presented to us through the raw data, reports and news articles we have been able to see that there is probably an increase in the total amount of opportunity youth, particularly within South King County. The Opportunity Youth Initiative that is undertaken by t he SRP and the a multi-sector initiative founded by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, Seattle Foundation, City of Seattle, and King County shows us that this initiative has been around for at least 5 years. Just by looking at the data, the outreach centers were mainly located within the North of King County. It wasn't until after 2016 that the initiative outreach program was within South King County. 

There are three areas of concern within our project: barriers, public relations and suggestions moving forward. 

## Barriers 
    A barrier that has been presented within the 2016 brief for Opportunity Youth in King county touches on the point that the quarterly data within King County has been reported with 'little fidelity'. A general assumption that we have here is that the cost to collect data, report it, or make it known is a big factor in inaccuracy. 
    Being able to update these figures from 2016 to 2017 will probably be more fragmented moving forward from the above generalisation. 
    
## PR
    As a means of attracting the target market within South King County, it may be useful to rebrand and or create a more positive connotation with the terms used to describe them. It will help to eliminate the stigma around the overarching difficulties that they face. 
    
## What we'd like to see moving forward from stakeholders ### in order to get accuracy of data what you can do to help youth along (overall problem) how to collect data in a cost efficient way and distribution of outreach 
    We can see that the outreach centers were only in the North of King County for most of the time the initiative has been up and running. The reason why there could be so many more opportunity youth within the South of King County could be a result of the implementation of the initiative not being brought in to the area sooner. 
    It would be useful to get more insight on the outreach program in terms of exact figures within these communities spread out across the county. In the graphical visualisations from the 2016 report you can see the maximum capacity for some of these outreach centers. However it does not show the demand and the need for each centre. This could be a huge determining factor with PUMA in those areas. 
    In terms of collecting data, depending on the budgets there could be a cost efficient way of onboaridng the youth, this could be through smartphone distribution with preloaded applications. Or even a simple application that these youth can download onto their phones to help give them all of the information they need to figure out the tools. Both would be able to collect more accurate data in real time.
