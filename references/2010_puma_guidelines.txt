Final Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) Criteria and Guidelines for the 
2010 Census and the American Community Survey 

SUMMARY: PUMAs are statistical geographic areas defined for the tabulation and dissemination 
of decennial census and American Community Survey (ACS)[1]  Public Use Microdata Sample 
(PUMS) data.[2]   Additionally, PUMAs are used in the publication of ACS period estimates.  Nesting 
within states, or equivalent entities,[3]  PUMAs cover the entirety of the United States, Puerto Rico, 
and the Island Areas that contain a 2010 Census population of 100,000 or more.[4]   PUMA delineations are subject to population, building block 
geography, geographic nesting, and contiguity criteria.  State Data Centers (SDCs) define PUMAs 
with the cooperation of regional, state, local, and tribal organizations and agencies.
  
This Notice announces the U.S. Census Bureau’s final criteria for the PUMA delineation program 
for the 2010 Decennial Census and the ACS.  In addition, this Notice contains a summary of 
comments received to proposed criteria published online from January 3, 2011 through February 
28, 2011 as well as the Census Bureau’s response to these comments. 
 
Most provisions of the PUMA criteria for the 2010 Census remain unchanged from those used in 
conjunction with Census 2000, except as follows.  First, the Census Bureau proposes the 
delineation of one level of PUMA for the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, as compared with two levels (PUMAs and Super-PUMAs) used for Census 2000.  Second, 
the required minimum population threshold of 100,000 persons must be maintained throughout the 
decade, as compared with the 2000 requirement to meet the minimum population threshold of 
100,000 persons at the time of delineation only.  Finally, the Census Bureau proposes the use of 
counties and census tracts as the only PUMA building block geography, as compared with counties, 
census tracts, minor civil divisions (in some states), and incorporated places with populations of 
100,000 persons or greater for Census 2000. 
 
Upon publication of the final criteria contained in this Notice, the Census Bureau will offer the 
SDCs, the opportunity to delineate 2010 PUMAs scheduled to begin in September 2011.  During 
the delineation process, SDCs are encouraged to consult with interested tribal, state, and local 
governments, organizations, and other data users.  

Date: This Notice’s final criteria will be effective upon approval. For additional information contact

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 

I.	Introduction 

Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files contain individual records of the characteristics for 
a sample of persons and households.[5]   PUMS files were first created for the 1960 Decennial 
Census.  For each census since 1960, PUMS data have been tabulated and published for 
selected geographic entities.  Until 1990, the geographic units for which PUMS data were 
available included states, counties, county groups, metropolitan areas, and urban areas.  Since 
1990, Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) have been delineated by the State Data Centers 
(SDCs) as a unique type of geographic area for the tabulation and dissemination of PUMS files.  
For Census 2000, the standard 5-percent PUMAs were defined along with the new 1-percent 
super-PUMAs, which were based upon aggregations of the smaller 5-percent standard PUMAs.[6]   
Migration (MIG) PUMAs and place-of-work (POW) PUMAs were created for use in the 
publication of MIG and POW microdata files. [7]  The ACS was fully implemented in the United States 
and Puerto Rico in January 2005.  Census 2000 PUMAs have been used in the tabulation and dissemination 
of ACS PUMS data and to present ACS period estimates.  In 2008, the Census Bureau released its 
first 3-year PUMS and estimates based on ACS data collected from 2005 through 2007.  The first 
5-year PUMS and estimates, based on ACS data collected from 2005 through 2009, were released on 
December 14, 2010.  

II.	Summary of Comments Received in Response to Proposed Criteria for the PUMA 
Delineation Program for the 2010 Census 

A.	Summary of changes: On January 1, 2011, the Census Bureau published PUMA 
proposed criteria on the U.S. Census Bureau’s website and solicited comments on 
the proposed criteria for delineating PUMAs for the 2010 Decennial Census.  The 
proposed criteria contained the following changes to the criteria used in the 2000 
Decennial Census: 
1)	Only one level of PUMA is proposed to be delineated for the United States, 
Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as compared with two levels 
(PUMAs and Super-PUMAs) used for Census 2000.  
2)	The required minimum population threshold of 100,000 persons must be 
maintained throughout the decade.  
3)	Counties and census tracts are proposed to be used as the only PUMA building 
block geographies, as compared with counties, census tracts, minor civil 
divisions (MCDs)[8], and incorporated places with populations of 100,000 
persons or greater for Census 2000.  
   
B.	Responses: The Census Bureau received letters and e-mails (each containing 
comments on several issues) from several organizations and individuals.  The 
correspondence received pertained mostly to the building block entities (3 above), 
specifically the elimination of incorporated places and MCDs as building block 
entities.  In addition, there were several comments regarding the recommended 
guidelines and further suggestions for the inclusion of specific research 
communities, governmental organizations, and local data users in the review 
process.  A major public policy research organization recommended a guideline to 
make PUMAs coincident with metropolitan boundaries.  Comments received are 
summarized below, as well as the Census Bureau’s response to these comments.  
   
1)	Comments on eliminating incorporated places and MCDs as a building block 
entity for 2010 PUMAs: The Census Bureau received four (4) comments 
opposed to the elimination of incorporated places and MCDs building block 
entities for 2010 PUMAs.  These comments were from a major public policy 
research organization as well as the states of California and Michigan 
representing state and local government agencies, and a regional organization.  

The public policy research organization recommended that cities (incorporated 
places) should continue to be used as PUMA building blocks.  This organization 
feels that their audience needs “real world” data that corresponds to the places 
where they live and work.  Their argument maintains that a vast majority of 
cities keep their boundaries consistent, and that data users need to access 
reliable data for these geographies.  The California local government agency 
also maintained that PUMAs should be allowed to be built from incorporated 
places with populations greater than 100,000, as data aggregated by incorporated 
places are more meaningful than data aggregated by large groups of census 
tracts.  The Michigan state agency objected to the elimination of MCDs and 
places with 100,000 residents because this would significantly decrease the 
utility of PUMS files.  A regional agency from Michigan objected to the 
elimination of MCDs as a building block entity because these entities are very 
important to their local data users and in a few instances, notably in the city of 
Ann Arbor and in Monroe county, census tracts do not correspond to MCD 
boundaries.  
          
The comment from a California university favored the proposed elimination of 
incorporated places building block entities since Los Angeles County currently 
has many noncontiguous PUMAs that are created where PUMAs are based on 
places that contain enclaves and exclaves.  This organization prefers to eliminate 
all such anomalies in favor of geographically contiguous areas.  

a)	The Census Bureau presents the following research to eliminate 
incorporated places as building blocks: 
(1)	Incorporated place-based PUMAs whose boundaries change over the 
decade represent significant PUMS publication disclosure risks for 
residence PUMAs and POW PUMAs.  This is of particular concern 
since annual PUMS will be published for 2010 PUMAs.  

Research reviewed by several internal Census Bureau committees 
(including the Disclosure Review Board (DRB), the Statistical Areas 
Committee (SAC), and the 2010 PUMA working group) provided 
convincing evidence that this represents a disclosure risk and, 
therefore, incorporated places should not be permitted as 2010 
PUMA building blocks.  

More specifically, changes in PUMA boundaries present ample 
opportunity for PUMS “geographic identification” as outlined in the 
Federal Register detailing the Criteria for Releasing Public Use 
Microdata (Vol. 68, No. 86)--see II.B.1.a.6 below.  These disclosure 
concerns apply in situations where PUMAs are built upon building 
block geography that changes over a decade (e.g., incorporated 
places that annexes or deannexes area).  In these cases the potential 
for creating a sliver piece of geography with low populations greatly 
increase the risk of disclosure.  

The Census Bureau found that nationally, incorporated places of 
100,000 or more residents only comprise 17% of all 2000 PUMAs.  
A majority (60%) of the place-based 2000 PUMAs (places with 
100,000 or more residents) have had annexations or deannexations 
over the past 10 years.  

Since changes in PUMA building block geography represent a 
disclosure risk for PUMS publication, and since a majority (60%) of 
all place-based 2000 PUMAs had annexations/deannexations from 
2000 to 2010, the Census Bureau will not permit the use of 
incorporated places as building blocks for 2010 PUMAs.  Census 
tracts provide much more stable boundaries, and may be aggregated 
to approximate the extent of other types of geographic entities.  

(2)	Follow-up research from participant comments found PUMAs built 
from incorporated places that contain enclaves and exclaves, some 
of which have very low populations (see items 4 and 5 below).  
Areas with low populations’ present opportunities for “geographic 
identification” as outlined in the Federal Register detailing the 
Criteria for Releasing Public Use Microdata (Vol. 68, No. 86)--see 
II.B.1.a.6 below.  To help ensure confidentiality of PUMS data, the 
Census Bureau set forth a new criterion for 2010 PUMAs: tract-
based PUMAs may cross county boundaries provided that each 
single PUMA-county part meets a minimum population threshold of 
2,400 persons (i.e., the 2010 Census minimum population threshold 
for a census tract (1,200) x 2).  This change seeks to eliminate 
unique geographic areas within a PUMA that contain low 
populations.  

(3)	It was argued that PUMS data would be less useful and meaningful if 
census tracts were used to approximate incorporated place or MCD 
boundaries, as the data would not relate to the actual building block 
geographic entity the PUMA was created to represent.  Since PUMS 
data are subject to “noise” (i.e., small amounts of variation) and data 
swapping, the PUMS data are less susceptible to the small 
differences between a census tract boundary and an incorporated 
place or MCD boundary, and these differences are not likely to have 
a significant impact on the representation of the PUMS data for an 
incorporated place or MCD.  
                       
(4)	California’s place-based PUMAs (places with 100,000 or more 
residents) represent 33% of all PUMAs in California.  A majority of 
these are noncontiguous (55%) and have had annexations or 
deannexations in the past 10 years (69%).  PUMAs built exclusively 
with more than one place represent only 6% of all PUMAs in 
California.  A majority of California’s place-based PUMAs, 
particularly those in Los Angeles County referenced by the 
respondent from a California university (above), represent 
significant disclosure risks from noncontiguous enclaves/exclaves, 
and sliver geography created from annexations or deannexations.  
Incorporated places are not stable boundaries in these instances and 
therefore cannot be permitted as building blocks in California.  
   
(5)	Michigan’s place-based PUMAs (places with 100,000 or more 
residents) represent 22% of all PUMAs in Michigan.  Half of these 
are noncontiguous (50%), and 38% have had annexations or 
deannexations in the past 10 years.  Ann Arbor, Michigan [9]  
exemplifies a place-based PUMA, with significant disclosure risks 
from both noncontiguous enclaves/exclaves and sliver geography 
created from annexations or deannexations.  Incorporated places are 
not stable boundaries in these instances and therefore cannot be 
permitted as building blocks in Michigan.  
                       
(6)	The following information, referred to in II.B.1.a.1 and II.B.1.a.2 
above, comes from the Federal Register/Vol. 68, No. 86/Monday, 
May 5, 2003/Notices, page 23694-Criteria for Releasing Public Use 
Microdata: 
                       
Once a file has been released with one set of geographic 
identification, the same records cannot be released with different 
identification if the two geographic schemes in combination identify 
any area with fewer than 100,000 population.  
       
Specifications for each file must be reviewed to assure 
confidentiality is protected.  To do so, the Census Bureau’s Checklist 
on Disclosure Potential of Data must be completed by the data 
producers and reviewed by disclosure experts at the Census Bureau.  
This review may result in: 

*	The introduction of “noise” (i.e., small amounts of variation) into 
selected data items.  

*	The use of data swapping (i.e., locating pairs of matching 
households in the database, based on a set of predetermined 
variables, and swapping those households across geographic areas 
to add uncertainty for households with unique characteristics).  

b)	Census Bureau presents the following research to eliminate MCDs as 
building blocks for 2010 PUMAs: 
(1)	In 29 states, MCDs are the primary governmental or administrative 
division of a county having legal boundaries, names, and 
descriptions.  MCDs represent different types of legal entities (i.e., 
towns, townships, boroughs, incorporated places) and vary in 
characteristics, powers, and functions depending upon the state and 
the type of MCD.  In the 12 states in which MCDs serve as general-
purpose local governments (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin), only 
Michigan provided opposing comments on this topic.  Presumably all 
other MCD states are satisfied with the proposed change from 
2000[10].  

(2)	In 20 MCD states [11] some or all of the incorporated places have 
governments that function independently from the jurisdiction of the 
surrounding MCD or MCDs, and these incorporated places are 
referred to as MCD equivalents.  The State of Michigan has two 
types of MCDs: those that are coextensive with an active 
incorporated place that is independent of any county subdivision 
and serves as a county subdivision or MCD equivalent, referred to 
here as ‘false MCDs;’ and those that are active county subdivisions 
that are not coextensive with an incorporated place, referred to here 
as ‘legal-general purpose MCDs.’ A minority (22%) of the 2000 
PUMAs were built on (solely consist of) one false 
MCDs/incorporated places. PUMAs that were built on multiple 
geographic entities, one or more of which were false 
MCDs/incorporated places accounted for only 19% of all PUMAs. 
The remaining PUMAs in Michigan were built with legal-general 
purpose MCDs, tracts, and/or counties.  Most Michigan PUMAs in 
2000 were tract-based, and therefore coincident with county 
boundaries.  

Most of the PUMAs in Michigan have a strong correlation with 
census tract and/or county boundaries.  Tracts and county 
boundaries provide stable building blocks for PUMAs and can be 
used to approximate the boundaries of MCDs in many cases.  
                    
c)	Additional guidelines to improve the utility and meaningfulness of the 
PUMA and PUMS/estimate data for PUMAs that were formerly 
delineated with incorporated places or MCDs as primary building 
blocks 

(1)	To improve the utility and meaningfulness of the PUMA and 
PUMS/estimate data, participants will have the ability to name 
PUMAs (so that the areas will be recognizable in name, if not 
precisely the same boundaries).  

(2)	To improve the utility and meaningfulness of the PUMA and 
PUMS/estimates data, PUMA equivalency files will be published on 
the Census Bureau’s website (as in Census 2000) to help users better 
understand the relationship between the PUMA and the underlying 
counties, county subdivisions (e.g., MCDs), places, and census 
tracts.  

2)	Guideline to make PUMAs coincident with Metropolitan Statistical Area 
Boundaries, as well as other place definitions, and principal cities: A major 
public policy research organization strongly recommends a guideline to make 
PUMAs coincident with metropolitan statistical area boundaries.  They support 
the guideline to define PUMAs that are either entirely inside or entirely outside a 
metropolitan statistical area whenever possible.  They also support the guidelines 
that   place definitions, urban/rural status, and local knowledge should inform 
PUMA delineation, and to maximize the number of standard PUMAs.  In 
addition they suggest that PUMAs be defined to approximate principal city 
boundaries so that researchers can use PUMA data to study differences between 
urban, suburban, and rural populations.  
   
a)	The Census Bureau recommends that PUMAs approximate 
metropolitan statistical area boundaries as well as other meaningful 
geographies: The participant should use counties and census tracts as 
the building blocks for the delineation of PUMAs to approximate the full 
extent of the metropolitan statistical area boundaries as well as other 
types of meaningful geographies (cities, etc).  This guideline is 
unchanged from Census 2000.  
   
b)	Metropolitan Statistical Areas available during 2010 PUMA 
delineation: Metropolitan and micropolitan areas available for the 2010 
PUMA delineation are those that are available as of January 1, 2010. 
These areas are not based on the results from the 2010 Census or the 
2010 ACS.   

3)	Include other organizations within the state during the 2010 PUMA delineation 
process: A regional organization from Missouri and transportation planning 
agencies from Maryland and New Mexico have suggested that local input should 
be required by the Census Bureau (rather than “recommended”) for PUMAs that 
include metropolitan statistical areas.  Groups such as the Tribal Governments, 
State Departments of Transportation (DOTs), and Metropolitan Planning 
Organizations (MPOs) are examples of organizations that can provide 
appropriate information and knowledge to develop boundaries for 2010 PUMAs 
in metropolitan areas.  
                
The Census Bureau strongly recommends local input for PUMAs in all 
areas: Existing partnerships established by the SDCs to support the 2010 
Census are recommended for the delineation of PUMAs in all areas, 
including metropolitan areas.  
                
C.	No Changes to the Final Criteria From the Proposed Criteria 

Upon reviewing all comments regarding appropriate building blocks as well as 
additional guidelines and recommendations, the Census Bureau will not put forth any 
new changes to the final criteria from the proposed criteria.  

III.	Final PUMA Criteria for the 2010 Census 

The criteria contained herein apply to the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas.  In 
accordance with the final criteria, the Census Bureau may modify and, if necessary, reject any 
proposals for PUMAs that do not meet the established criteria.  In addition, the Census Bureau 
reserves the right to modify the boundaries and attributes of PUMAs as needed to maintain 
geographic criteria and relationships before the final 2010 PUMA geography is finalized.  

The Census Bureau will use the following criteria and characteristics to identify the areas that 
will qualify for designation as PUMAs for use in tabulating data from the 2010 Census and the 
ACS.  
       
A.	One level of PUMAs will be delineated for the 2010 Census.  
The Census Bureau previously published two levels of PUMA geography 
corresponding to the two types of PUMS files available (1-percent super-PUMA and 
5-percent standard PUMA).  Because 1-percent PUMS files are not produced for the 
ACS and are not planned for the 2010 Census, only one type of PUMA—the 
standard 5-percent PUMA—is needed.  The standard PUMAs for 2010 will be used 
to tabulate and present decennial census and ACS PUMS as well as ACS period 
estimates.  

B.	Each PUMA must have a population of 100,000 or more.  Each PUMA must 
contain a minimum population of 100,000 at the time of delineation.
PUMAs with a population substantially below 100,000 persons present disclosure 
concerns for the ongoing publication of ACS PUMS and potentially for ACS 
estimates.  If the population of a PUMA falls substantially below the minimum 
population threshold of 100,000 through the decade, the Census Bureau will 
evaluate the disclosure risk and may combine the PUMA with one or more adjacent 
PUMAs for ACS data publication to ensure data confidentiality. For those areas 
currently experiencing population decline, or where population decline is 
anticipated, PUMAs should be delineated to encompass a population substantially 
higher than 100,000 persons such that the population will remain above 100,000 
throughout the decade.  

C.	PUMAs may not cross state boundaries.  

D.	Counties and equivalent entities [12] and census tracts [13] will be the geographic 
“building blocks” for PUMAs.  

       
Examples of PUMA building blocks are provided in the map examples below (Maps 1 – 3).  

1.	One county may be designated as a PUMA as long as it meets the minimum 
threshold of 100,000 persons (MAP 1).  

 
Map 1: Humboldt County, California in 2000 
One county may be designated as a PUMA as long as it meets the minimum population threshold 
of 100,000 persons. This is a close-up map of Humboldt County, California shown with medium 
gray tint. It shows the boundary for Humboldt County and the boundary for PUMA 00200 that is 
coincident with the county boundary. Incorporated place boundaries within Humboldt County 
and the surrounding areas are shown in a darker gray tone. PUMAS 00400, 00500, and 00100 
that border PUMA 00200 are also shown and labeled on this map. PUMA boundaries are shown 
with a dark gray line. County boundaries are shown with a dashed line.  

2.	Two or more contiguous counties may be aggregated to create a PUMA 
(MAP 2).  Tract-based PUMAs may cross county boundaries provided that 
each single PUMA-county part meets a minimum population threshold of 
2,400 persons (i.e., double the 2010 Census minimum population threshold 
for a census tract, 1,200 persons).  This minimum population threshold for 
census tract populations that cross county boundaries is a new criterion for 
2010 to ensure confidentiality of data within a single PUMA-county part 
(MAP 3).  

Census tracts may be aggregated to approximate the extent of other types of 
other geographic entities, including MCDs, incorporated places, census 
designated places (CDPs), and/or urban areas (UAs).  
        
Map 2: Multi-County PUMAs in Vermont in 2000 
Two or more contiguous counties may be aggregated to create a PUMA.  This map shows the 
whole state of Vermont and the boundaries for the four PUMAs that are contained in this 
state. (00100, 00200, 00300, 00400). All PUMAs in Vermont are aggregates of three or more 
counties. All county boundaries within these four PUMAs are shown. PUMA boundaries are shown 
with a dark gray line. County boundaries are shown with a dashed line.  
        
Map 3: PUMA 00900 in Piscataquis County, Penobscot County, 
and Census Tract 410 in Waldo County, Maine in 2000 
Tract-based PUMAs may cross county boundaries provided that each single PUMA-county-part meets 
a minimum threshold of 2,400 persons.  This is a close-up map of the central part of Maine, 
and the PUMA boundaries for PUMA 00900 and 00500 are shown and labeled.  A dark gray tint shows 
that PUMA 00900 is comprised of two counties Piscataquis County and Penobscot County) and census 
tract 410 in a third county (Waldo County).  A label on the map shows that the single PUMA county 
part in Waldo County (Census Tract 410) has a population of 3,602 persons.  PUMA boundaries are 
shown with a dark gray line. County boundaries are shown with a dashed line and census tract 
boundaries are shown with a thin gray line. 

E.	POW PUMAs and/or MIG PUMAs are larger aggregates of standard PUMAs 
and can consist of a single PUMA for county-based PUMAs, or a combination of 
adjacent tract-based PUMAs.  When combined, these larger PUMAs may be 
aggregates of one or more complete counties (MAP 4).  
       
The Census Bureau defines POW PUMAs and MIG PUMAs to provide detailed 
characteristics regarding workers and their work places and detailed characteristics 
for migrants, respectively.  

Map 4: POW and MIG PUMA 00700 in Ohio in 2000 
POW and MIG PUMA 00700 is comprised of three standard PUMAs (00701, 00702, 00703) within two 
counties (Lake County and Geauga County) in northeastern Ohio. This is a close-up map of Lake and 
Geauga counties. Boundaries for the POW and MIG PUMA 00700 are shown with a dark gray tint. PUMA 
boundaries are shown with a dark gray line. County boundaries are shown with a dashed line and census 
tract boundaries are shown with a thin gray line.
       
F.	Each PUMA must constitute a geographically contiguous area.  
       
A PUMA may be noncontiguous only if a county or a census tract used as a 
building block for the PUMA is noncontiguous.  
       
IV.	2010 PUMA guidelines 

The Census Bureau does not require participants to adhere to the following guidelines, but 
strongly encourages participants to consider the benefits of creating geographic entities that 
conform to these guidelines.  In some instances, it may be geographically impossible to adhere 
to some of these guidelines.  
A.	Wherever possible, each PUMA should comprise an area that is either entirely inside 
or entirely outside metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas.  

B.	The Census Bureau recommends that 2010 place definitions, 2000 urban/rural 
definitions, and local knowledge inform PUMA delineations.  

C.	The number of standard PUMAs should be maximized, and PUMAs should not 
contain more than 200,000 persons, wherever possible, unless the PUMA is defined 
for an area in which population decline is anticipated.  

D.	PUMAs should avoid unnecessarily splitting American Indian reservations (AIRs) 
and/or off-reservation trust lands (ORTLs), and separating American Indian 
populations, particularly if large numbers of American Indians are included within 
all parts of the split AIRs/ORTLs (MAP 5).  Since AIRs/ORTLs may cross state 
boundaries, this guideline applies only to the portion of an AIR/ORTL within a state. 
In addition, multiple AIR/ORTLS with low populations may be combined with other 
AIR/ORTLs to delineate a PUMA within a state.  In all such instances, the total 
population and makeup of the affected areas should be considered in any decisions 
regarding the adjustment of PUMAs for AIRs/ORTLs. The goal of this guideline is 
not to make PUMA boundaries noncontiguous or needlessly complex and separate 
their relationship from other important geographic boundaries like counties. Census 
tracts for the 2010 Census had a similar requirement, so by limiting 2010 PUMA 
building block geography directly to counties and census tracts, this should make 
following this guideline more straightforward.

  
Map 5: Lake Traverse Reservation in 2000 
The Lake Traverse Reservation boundaries cross North Dakota and South Dakota state boundaries 
and are contained within three separate PUMAs --00300 (ND), 00300 (SD), and 00400 (SD).  
The portion of Lake Traverse Reservation within PUMA 00400 contained a population of 1,924 
persons in Census 2000.  For 2010, PUMAs should avoid unnecessarily splitting AIR/ORTL. This is 
a close-up map of Lake Traverse Reservation within the eastern portions of North Dakota and 
South Dakota. The reservation is shown with a dark gray tint. PUMA boundaries are shown with a 
dark gray line. County boundaries are shown with a dashed line and census tract boundaries are 
shown with a thin gray line.  

The Census Bureau may add additional delineation guidelines to which participants are strongly 
encouraged, but not required, to follow.  

V.	Additional Information Pertaining to 2010 PUMAs 
          
A.	PUMA names: Where applicable, descriptive PUMA names may be assigned by 
SDCs to individual areas or regions to aid local identification.  This is new for the 
2010 Census and will enable participants to provide a name for a PUMA, 
identifying the area or region encompassed within the PUMA.  

1)	PUMA names should be recognized and used in daily communication by the 
residents of the community.  
2)	A PUMA may not have the same name as an adjacent or nearby PUMA.  

B.	PUMA codes: If the geographic extent of a proposed 2010 PUMA is primarily 
unchanged from Census 2000, the Census Bureau will attempt to retain the same 
code as was used for Census 2000.  SDCs should indicate their preferences to retain 
codes for specific PUMAs.  

C.	Definitions of key terms used in the PUMA criteria document are in Appendix A:

VI.	Definitions  

Contiguous— A description of areas sharing common boundaries, such that the areas, 
when combined, form a single piece of territory.  Noncontiguous areas form disjoint pieces.

Microdata— The individual records which contain information collected about each 
person and housing unit. 

Statistical Geographic Entity—A geographic entity that is specially defined and 
delineated, such as block group, CDP, or census tract, so that the Census Bureau may 
tabulate data for it.  Designation as a statistical entity neither conveys nor confers legal 
ownership, entitlement, or jurisdictional authority. 

[1]  The ACS is conducted in the United States and in Puerto Rico.  In Puerto Rico the survey is called the Puerto Rico 
Community Survey (PRCS).  For ease of discussion, throughout this document the term ACS is used to represent the 
surveys conducted in the United States and in Puerto Rico, as well as their data products.  

[2]  PUMS are files which contain individual records of the characteristics for a sample of persons and households.  

[3]  States are the primary governmental divisions of the United States.  The District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are 
treated as statistical equivalents of a state for data presentation purposes.  The Census Bureau treats Puerto Rico, 
America Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands as state 
equivalents as well.  For Census Bureau purposes, the United States includes the fifty States and the District of 
Columbia.  

[4]  There was only one PUMA delineated for each of the state equivalents of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands in Census 2000; therefore, the Guam and U.S. Virgin Islands SDCs did not delineate PUMAs.  American Samoa and the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands do not meet the minimum population threshold for PUMS 
publication; therefore, PUMAs were not delineated in these areas.  At the time of publication, the 2010 Census population counts were not yet released for the Island Areas.  A 2010 PUMA will be delineated for those Island Areas that contain a 2010 Census population of 100,000 or more.  

[5]  Further information about microdata, PUMS, and confidentiality of PUMS data is provided on the Census Bureau 
website.  Please refer to http://www.census.gov/main/www/pums.html and

website.  Please refer to http://www.census.gov/geo/puma/puma_history.pdf (or view the text version).  

[7]  POW and MIG PUMA geographies were based on one or more 5-percent PUMAs.  In cases where 5-percent 
PUMAs encompassed one or more whole counties, the MIG and POW PUMAs were equivalent to the 5-percent 
PUMA geography; however, when 5-percent PUMAs contained other types of geographic entities, the MIG and 
POW PUMAs were based on aggregations of two or more 5-percent PUMAs in order to encompass whole counties.  
Within the six New England states (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and 
Connecticut), MIG and POW PUMAs encompassed minor civil division (city and town)-based 5-percent PUMAs.  

[8]  For 2000 PUMAs, MCDs were permitted as PUMA building block geographies only within the six New England 
states.  

[9]  Michigan PUMA 03200 comprises Ann Arbor city and is extremely complex, including 4 exclaves and 86 enclaves 
(holes).  Ann Arbor reported 194 annexations from January 1, 2000 through January 1, 2010.  Total acreage 
annexed in that time, as reported in the Boundary and Annexation Survey, was 669.3 acres.  Throughout Michigan, 
there were 794 legal boundary changes in the past 10 years, involving 21,345 acres.  

[10]  For 2000 PUMAs, only MCDs in the New England states were permitted to be used as PUMA building block 
geographies.  

[11]  In 20 states (Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, 
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South 
Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin) a majority of the MCDs are general-purpose governmental units.  A majority of 
these MCDs are legally designated as towns or townships.  

[12]  Includes parishes in Louisiana; boroughs and census areas in Alaska; independent cities in Maryland, Missouri, 
Nevada, and Virginia; that portion of Yellowstone National Park in Montana; districts in American Samoa; the 
three main islands of the U.S. Virgin Islands; municipalities in the Northern Mariana Islands; municipios in Puerto 
Rico; and the entire areas constituting the District of Columbia and Guam.  

[13]  Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity that are 
updated by local participants prior to each decennial census. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a 
stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data. Standard census tracts used for the delineation 
of PUMAs are coincident with state and county boundaries.  Tribal census tracts are not used in the delineation of 
PUMAs. The tribal census tract are a unique geographic entity defined within federally recognized American Indian 
reservations and off-reservation trust lands and can cross state and county boundaries. Tribal census tracts may be 
completely different from the census tracts and block groups defined by state and county.
